*****panel : could you please explain me patching procedure
		we have PMO team who will co-ordinate the changes.
	PMO team will schedule meeting for change implementation.
		patching is scheduled for 10 servers. 
	Step 1 : we join in  scheduled meeting and then we request backup team to complete backup for scheduled servers.
	Step 2 : paralely we take the snapshot for all scheduled servers and disable the alerts.
	Step 3 : We collect the prechecks and keep in the notepad 
			kernel version, current os version, partitions information, volume group and lvs information and all.
				uname -r;hostname;cat /etc/os-release;date;df -h;vgs;lvs;pvs;cat /etc/fstab
	Step 4 : we request application and db team to stop the respective application in scheduled servers.
		===========================================
			scheduled servers = 7 are application severs
				                     3 are db
		who will stop the application in 7 servers? application team
			which is first app or db while stopping? 
				application ==> db
			while starting
			==========
			start db ==> start application
		===============================================
	Step 5 : we reboot the shceduled servers once we get confirmation from application and db team once they stop application and db.			
			this reboot is before patching to confirm no issues with server before patching.
			if server is up that means no existing problems in server.
		
	Step 6 : if server is up then we verify is the server is integrated with satellite or not, if not integrated we integrate now. 
			using subscripton-manager we register redhat server with satellite
		if server is suse then we run bootstrap script to register server with suma manager.
	Step 7 : now server is registered then we continue patching in scheduled servers
			yum update    command for redhat servers
				and zypper update for suse servers.
		we observ the patching progress and reboot the servers once after patching.
	Step 8 : once server is up after patching then we collect post checks and validate those post checks with prechecks. here mainly we verify
			partitions are same and kernel version got changed and all verified.
	Step 9 : if everything looks good like kernel version is updated and os version also updated then we request app and db team to start respective things
			in scheduled severs.
	Step 10 : we close change task if application working fine.
		and logoff from meeting.

 
After patching application team is saying application is not working?
	first we boot with previous kernel and ask team to start now application.
		if application is working with old kernel that means compatability between application and new kernel.
		
	roll back
	=======	
	using snapshot we just merge and ask application team to start the things

*****panel will ask how you revert everything without merging snapshot?
		step 1 : reboot and boot with old kernel
			while booting select old kernel in grub screen and press enter
		Step 2 : make sure old repository is configured in client machine
			we enable old version repository using subscription-manager
				subscription-manager --enable=<old repository id>
		Step 3 :  remote the kernel protection file
			rm -rf /etc/yum/protected.d/systemd.conf
